Help me Obi-Wan! Someone had stolen the last CTF flag from my databank. The Betrayer is on this Discord server. Try to find him and message me with his nickname like this: /gotcha nick
```

and then i've looked for anyone that stands off

found old bot illidian and reported him to the main bot ```/gotcha illidian```

then I had to visit page /ctf8/ and then scan the QR code

and got the flag

# 9 - bonus

before the CTF got started there was one flag to report
